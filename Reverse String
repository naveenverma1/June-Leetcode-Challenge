Reverse String

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
Example 2:

Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
   Hide Hint #1  
The entire logic for reversing a string is based on using the opposite directional two-pointer approach!

Solution

class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
      int low = 0;
        int high = s.length-1;
        while(low<high){
            char temp = s[low] ;
            s[low] = s[high];
            s[high] = temp;
            low++;
            high--;
        }
       System.out.print(s);
    }
}
